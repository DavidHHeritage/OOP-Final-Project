Languages: Java & C#<br />

* Language purpose/genesis (Why was it created, what problem was it trying to solve?. is teh language a reaction to a previos language fr a replacement for another?)

  * Java
     * The Java programming language was originally designed by James Gosling and was created in hopes of creating a less implementation dependant language. This language was trying to create the "write once, run anywhere" method for developers. By this I mean, the code written would be able to be ran on any and all platforms that support Java without need of recompilation. Most Java applications are compiled using bytecode whcih can be ran on any Java virtual machine reguardless of the computers operating system and architecture. By creating this language Mr Gosling was able to create a independent platform programming language.

  * C#
    * The C# programming language was created by Microsoft and when they made it they had a small list of objectives for C#. These objectives that were accomplished can be interpretted as the languages purpose of creation. They claimed that C# was simple, modern, object-oriented, powerful/flexible, a language of few words, modular, and that it would be popular.
     
      * Why is it simple?
        * The syntax for C# is based off of the languages C and C++ so that the code can be easily understood for most begginer level programmers. To make the language even easier to use they altered some of the syntax. The language also tried to simplify concepts of object oriented languages by removing aspects such as macros, templates, multiple inheritance, and virtual base classes. 
       * Why is it modern?
         * This language is considered modern simply due to the fact that it is capable of using features such as exception handling, garbage collection, and extensible data types.
       * Why is it powerful/flexible?
         * When programming in C# there are no limitations to what you are capable of doing. The language can be used for things such as word processors, graphics, compilers for other languages, etc.
       * Why is C# a language of few words?
         * C# only has a small list of keywords. By having a small list of keywords the language is further simplified and easily understood.
       * Why is C# modular?
         * C# can be written in chunks of code named classes and the classes can conatian routines known as member methods. Using these classes and methods you are able to create useful, reusable code.
         
   * Unique Features
     * Java
       * Objects are the primary unit of composition.
       * Checked Exceptions.
       * Unicode strings.
       * Documentation focus.
       * Compatibility focus.
       * Garbage Collection.
     * C#
       * Assemblies
       * Cross-language compatibility is first-class
       * Properties are first-class
       * listeners are first-class
       * Foreign methods are first-class
       * Partial Classes
       
   * Name spaces
     * Java
       
     * C#
